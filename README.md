# FIBONACCI_TEST
HELLO THIS IS THE FIRST GIT HUB REPOSITORY THAT I CREATED. 
It is a recursive fibonacci generator(I love recursion), I am thinking of splitting the initial idea into two branches:-
*A ten number fibo generator(main)
*User input determined fibo generator(patch)(user input is awesome)
Update 16/4/2021 The code performs optimally after today's change. I will also implement the second branch today and run tests to determine if the code performs well.








Note:-IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE CODE AND PLAY WITH IT I'm PRETTY OKAY WITH IT :)
